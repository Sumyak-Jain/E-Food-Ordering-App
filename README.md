##  Overview

The existing system of ordering at UPES food court is manual as the student has to go to the food counter to order the food. But this can lead to an increase in chances of Covid-19 as students would not maintain the social distance at the food court because they have breaks for less time and mostly at the same time. This system would lead to the crowd at the ordering counter as well as the food court counter.

To avoid such a situation, we have suggested "E- food ordering app" which will help the students to order food online anytime from anywhere. Using, this app vendors can manage and accept the number of the order they are receiving. Once the order is completed the vendor can inform the customer for the completion of the order by pressing the order ready button on the app. 

Our app can be used by both students as well as vendors. Students can place the order from anywhere and select the items from the e-menu and make the payment and once the order is completed they are notified about the completion of the order and they can collect their order from the food counter. Vendors can receive the order and they can edit the items on the menu according to the availability of the items and once the order is completed they can notify the user.
This app simplifies the process of food ordering for both the customer and the vendors.
